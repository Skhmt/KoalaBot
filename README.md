#### What is this?
It's a moderation bot for Twitch meant for roughly the same things as nightbot, moobot, ankhbot, deepbot, etc. This is and always will be free and open source. It runs off your desktop. I'm always open to feature requests, bug reports, and any constructive critique. Hit me up on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/skhmt/profile) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SkTTV) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=skhmt&subject=twitch%20bot).

#### How to use:
* For Windows: Run koalaBot.exe
* For OS X: NWJS is no longer available from the app store, but is available at their [website](https://nwjs.io/). Download the Koalabot osx .zip and unzip it into the same directory as nwjs.app. Run nwjs.app. OSX may prompt that the application is from an untrusted source. If that happens, go to settings > Security & Privacy > General, and set the "Allow Apps from Anywhere" option and launch the application. After launching for the first time, it would be a good idea to set the securtiy settings back to "App Store and Identified Developers".
* Go to Settings > Bot Config
* Click "Get Token"
* If Windows pops up something about the firewall, click OK. 
* Log in to the Twitch account you want the bot to be
* If you're using the bot on an account other than the one you stream on, make sure the bot is both a mod and an editor for your channel. To make the bot an editor, go to your Twitch Dashboard on your main account.

#### Making modules:
Modules are HTML5 + javascript (ES6) + jQuery (2.2.0) + Boostrap (3.3.6). See my [example module](https://gist.github.com/Skhmt/5b2f4300c0e7a82e654e) for working example. To install it, save it as a .js file and place it in the \mods\ folder, then restart the bot. Also see the [API](https://github.com/Skhmt/twitch-bot/blob/master/MODULE%20API.md) for more details and some functionality not used in example.js. Share modules via [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) or [Gist](http://gist.github.com).

#### Making themes:
Themes are just Bootstrap 3.3.6 .css files. Put them in the themes folder and restart the bot.
